I am shutting down all github work, there is to much bullshit going around here and copilot is just one of them. 
I have setup https://code.botwork.se/ (gitea) and started the progress of moving my projects there. When I am done moving I will freeze all projects on GH (they will be left in the state they are with a link and explenation).

The reasoning around my descision is long and in some parts a complex one. I can try to explain it with pointing to the copilot nonsense. Why would I give copilote ( and in the extension Microsoft) my code to train on? Is it not enough with all the free hours put into open source? MS is NOT in any way/shape or form doing open source out of a "good will"! Everything they do is rooted into making money, and in this case they are doing it on the back of devs that put in free labor! But this is actually not all, I could have lived with this fact if the result was even remotely close to pushing humanity forward. Its not! "We" (read Microsoft) is killing innovation with copilot, they are also making people dumb! And on top of that eliminating a generation of potential coders. I do not want to contribute to this! I know my descision does nothing to the end result, but just putting on blindfolds will have the exact same result apart from actually writing this and hope that some people read it and agree (or even just think about it for a couple of minutes).
Apart from the above, I am going BACK to creating things on my spare time for my own problems! If those problems that I solve can solve someone elses problem then that is great! If someone gives back to the project because they feel they want to then thats even better. But getting into the "end-level"-instance-run-grind where you break your back trying to fix a problem that is really not even anything I have a problem with, and have a constant "Why have you not fixed this, you lazy s**t"-feedback thank you like a little cherry ontop of that... Who in their right mind needs that?

I write code for 2 reasons. *One* I want to solve a problem I have, or to enhance my life/workflow in some way. *Two* I love code! This also means that I am willing to improve it just out of the reason to improve it (but not so that a greedy company can make even more money). But in later times when I have done this i have gotten more or less the feedback that "we want to keep it the way it is" without even a hint to why that is the case. I bet my left nut on that the reason for this feedback is that copilot had no idea of how to respond because it dont care and in extension this goes for the actual human performing the review (sorry, i am sure you care about revenue and/or other parts of the program but you dont care about code). I would love to have heard why, and I might even could have seen the reasoning but there where more a feel of "dont argue, just write the code as I want it pesant". In response to this I can just say... Use copilot! I have zero interest in providing anything at all as a "human copilot" and I will fix my shit for me locally until I replace your code/program with either something I find or something I write myself and then share the solution as an alternative.

A couple of QA:
* How would you get feedback?
  - If someone really care about an actual bug/feature request I am sure they will sign up and write it on Botwork. If they dont I tend to think the problem is actually not that serious.
  - GH issue-tracking is really not the only option! Gitea (among a lot of others) does this just as good.
  - I dont want any copilot shit and this move will minimize that spam.
* How can you support/code other projects that now live on GH?
  - First answer would be, I wont! And I'm not sad about it TBH. Code and programs that I use is not set in stone and I am about a zero nostalgic feeling about it. We need and should evolve, even when that means actually replacing program/code that we spent a lot time learning and using. Reason is (among other) our brains need excerise and not just feeling "good enough"-content.
  - Secondly, if I really need to I can just fork it to Botwork, do the work and then mirror 1 specific branch to GH that I open a PR from. When PR is merged I will just delete the project.
* But what about the community part of GH.
  - Dont need it! It is the thing I might miss though. But we have chats and so many other places to interact that GH really is not needed.
  - Same as with colab, I'm not deleting my account and will use it when needed but only for the need.

I will come back and rewrite this as I go, for anyone interested...
